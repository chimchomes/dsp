# Git Safety Protocol
- NEVER execute `git commit` or `git push` on your own.
- You must WAIT for the user to explicitly type "COMMIT" or "PUSH" in the chat.
- After making a change, summarize what you did and ask: "Changes are ready for testing. Should I COMMIT these now?"
- If the user says something is broken, DO NOT try to fix it by writing more code—ask if they want to REVERT to the last working commit first.
